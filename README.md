# React Local CRUD App with Hooks

This does ... Create a a book data, Read a list of books from 
a data source, Updates the data and Deletes the Data. All 
happens locally and stored into LocalStorage. 

## Available Scripts

useState & useEffect hooks are used. Also Formik lib with Yup
validation was used for Forms. I've created my own Form component Lib using Formik & Yup.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
